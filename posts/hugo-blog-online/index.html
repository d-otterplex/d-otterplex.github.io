It&rsquo;s not a lot, but it sure took a lot of work to actually get up and running.</p><p>At first I was recommended to use <a href=https://jekyllrb.com/>Jekyll</a> for my blog, and I learned quite a bit, and even made this blog ready to use in it, until I found that <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a> was another static site generator that existed, and was supposedly <em>faster</em>.</p><p>So in the end I just ended up making two blogs: one destined for the trash and one that you see now. Hugo felt a lot different and possibly more difficult to set up personally, but I enjoyed setting them up.</p><p>In any case, this blog is probably going to be more of a thought dump than anything, so don&rsquo;t expect much from it, lol.</p></body></html>
